## Adventures
Hopping around the area has been a lot of fun for a nerd and a half like me (and less so for Adrienne who really only has an interest in the wine and the art).  Got to explore the Google and Stanford campus, as well as the NASA Ames research facility (yeah.. quit a geeky segment of the trip).  

## Living

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Geeky as hell  (startups and people) | Packed in like sardines, not as bad as ny |
| Lots of opportunities | Quite expensive: housing + living |
| Great views of the mountains | Not as green as I would have expected |
| Diverse food and quite tasty | Saturated and I expect divergence |
| Lots of options for exploration / other things to do |      |
| Close to ocean     |      |
