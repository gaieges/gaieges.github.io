## Adventures
Hopping around the area has been a lot of fun for a nerd and a half like me (and less so for Adrienne who really only has an interest in the wine and the art).  Got to explore the Google and Stanford campus, as well as the NASA Ames research facility (yeah.. quite a geeky segment of the trip).

We started by getting a flight from Austin the day before (which surprisingly wasn't too expensive), and getting in late on a Friday.  Without us knowing whatsoever, we ended up on the last flight that US Airways would ever run.  Not only was this part of aviation history that tons of @avgeeks were following every segment of, they had a party and gifts at every gate.  We ended up getting a water cannon salute, some cupcakes and cookies, and a glass of champagne on the ride.  Not a bad gig.  Give me a seat that reclines into a bed and I'll come back for seconds.

That night, We bummed around San Mateo for a little while and came away with the impression that it was a very Asian-centric town (noodle spots everywhere) for young and old people alike.  Didn't see many groups of people in the middle.

The next day we headed up to see the geeky stuff above, and then went to a Stanford dive bar. The place reeked of beer, had sticky floors and bars, 4 people in it, and surprisingly: a playboy pinball that my family ironically had in our basement.  Unfortunately, neither of them work.  After a decent beer, we headed over to this [Korean restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dae-bak-santa-clara) that was **amazing**. I can't even begin to explain how tasty this squid stir-fry was.  On top of that, the waiter recommended we get some Soju with some weirdly tasty raspberry additive for flavoring (I guess they accept that Soju isn't very good but they still need to to get you wasted really fast).

Next we went up to wine country, with a quick detour through downtown SF and Adrienne's old hometown.  Got some wine at a winery and continued on to Napa where we had some **great** brussel sprouts (and to a lesser degree, pizza).  

At this point, I was just getting tired of hopping around from place to place, and wanted to chill a bit.  So we picked a place out in Santa Cruz to go stay at, and bolted down there after a quick stop in Berkley (nothing notable there aside from some hippy homeless peeps).  Out of fucking nowhere, we found a crapton (is that the official definition?) of sea lions living and sleeping under the wharf.  They were trying to take a nap, and burping / grunting at each other when they got up in each others grills.  It was so cool to watch underneath an amazing west coast sunset.

We also learned that the area is quite bummy .. lots of hippies on the corner trying to make money by playing a tune and having a dog to sucker the college girls.  It's not a huge town, and the downtown area is largely one street that stretches about a quarter to a half mile long.  The thing I liked about this town is that it was laid-back, and full of surfer dudes.  We spent a little time near the cost and watched some surfers get dangerously close to the cliffs of the coast while avoiding each other on a wave.

Driving up the coast, there were a lot of good spots for hanging on the beach, with few people (likely because it was a Tuesday).  One of them had a ton of kite surfers, doing tricks on the waves basically living the dream.  It was a side-wind, so they had no problem going out far into the Pacific and come back without any problems.  The entire area was full of gorgeous scenery: huge sand-colored cliffs with green buzz cuts at the top overlooked the seemingly endless Pacific.  It's often underrated to see the sun set on it, and especially cool to see as an east coaster.

The last stop on the SF trip ended up being a cool brewery in half moon bay <span style="color:red;">linkneeeded</span> overlooking the sea.  Great spot with all sorts of quality drinks and seafood.  Highly recommended.

## Living

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Geeky as hell  (startups and people) | Packed in like sardines, but not as bad as ny |
| Lots of opportunities | Quite expensive: housing + living |
| Great views of the mountains | Not as green as I would have expected |
| Diverse food and quite tasty | Saturated and I expect divergence |
| Lots of options for exploration / other things to do | Traffic, but not as bad as I expected |
| Sprawling | Sprawling - getting to the other side of the bay takes forever |
| Close to ocean |  |
