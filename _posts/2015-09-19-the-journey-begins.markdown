Only a few more days.. until the journey begins

Soon, Adrienne and I will abandon all of our belongings, pack a to-go bag, and hop into a car where we intend to hop-skotch across the southern part of the US.  

You'd think that having done this once before, I'd be prepared.  But who am I kidding .. we'll never have everything we need given the limitless amount of things that could happen, so hopefully we at least get the important stuff like a wallet and keys for the car.

Here's the path we're headed:
