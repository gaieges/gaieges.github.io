## Adventures
Luckily this was one of the cheaper parts of the trip thanks to **G-dawg** and the cheap alcohol and food in the area, which gave us freedom to spend money on other fun things like [trampoline parks](http://www.rushathens.com/) (which is an awesomely fun place to get some exercise and throw things at people that get on your nerves).

Our first night there, a casual "one-drink" trip to the bar ended up turning into a shot at all her favorite bars, some FIFA 15 on a big screen in a dive-y bar, and a hangover like I haven't had in years.  I often don't feel the need to throw up the next morning, and instead want to pound as much coffee and eggs as possible; but this an exceptional morning (read: day).  Looking at food even made me want to throw up on the table in front of me.  Now I remember why I often partake in the less impactful vices.

The outdoors is a big selling point for GA: lush vegetation and wildlife everywhere (but no alligators in the rivers to my dissappointment).  Our mini-hike through the school's [Botanical Gardens](http://botgarden.uga.edu/) was relaxing and educational.  While I've forgot everything I learned at that stop, it was still nice to come away with some pictures of colorful plants and flowers.

Bulldogs are EVERYWHERE!  Not surprisingly given it's the school mascot, but lots of good things to bring to home to a family that won't even think twice about getting any other type of dog.  At least in our family they appreciate a cute one, rather than the school's mascot who looks like a chubby, more wrinkly version of an albino narwhal.
