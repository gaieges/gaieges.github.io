## Adventures

First night in was awful - had an AirBNB booked with some guy who couldn't manage to open the door for us, either because he didnt have signal or was asleep. Instead we had to go a few blocks down and spend a bunch more money to have to get a last minute extended stay.  It all worked out but at 1am after a 2.5hr drive it was the last thing I wanted to have to deal with.  Luckily AirBNB customer support refunded all of the money, even though he benefited a percentage of it, and AirBNB ate the rest of the costs.

The city isn't too small, but not crazy large either.  Getting around on large roads is simple, and when the speed limit is 75 on the outside roads, you can get places decently fast.  Unfortunately, Texas is spread pretty far apart so that 75mph limit hardly compensates for it's size.  

The roads here are shit, most of the time.  The smaller ones especially.  The interstate and state sanctioned roads you can speed along no problem but when it comes to getting around the narrow 4 lane inner-city streets - you gotta work for it and so do your shocks.

It's pretty neat how colorful and creative Austin is.  The people are always wearing something interesting that attracts the eyes and the mind.  We were able to walk into several bars on a Tues night and play video games, skee-ball, pinball, pool, etc.

We ended up going to two museums, and the [state capitol building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Capitol).  The capitol is pretty incredible: you get B&L full access to the building (as most of the actual important people are in the extension building they recently put in).  They allow you to explore the senate and house chambers, talk to random important people (senators / reps?) you see roaming the halls.
